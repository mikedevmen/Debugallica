This is our project for the unit COS10026 (Web Technology Project) in our second semester at Swinburne Vietnam. In about two months, we have built a fully deployable employment website for a fictional technology company named "Debugallica" 
using HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL and many other tools. The website features many pages such as job description page or job application page with responsive design to ensure usability across various devices. The website also includes user 
authentication and dynamic MySQL databases to store user data.
